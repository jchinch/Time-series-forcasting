# Time-series-forcasting
Implemented Simple Moving Average(SMA), Exponential Moving Average(EMA), AutoRegression(AR) model by calculating the required parameter by parameter tuning. Used these models to predict the temperature data collected from local weather station. Compared the accuracy for all models by calculating RMSE error.
